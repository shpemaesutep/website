                                      I joined SHPE/MAES because I love to help others, but I stayed in SHPE/MAES because I found my familia and a place to grow both professionally and personally.

                                      My favorite SHPE/MAES memory was when peers were sharing their offers, knowing that all the hours of work resulted in a member getting an offer is the greatest feeling in the world.`;

                                      My favorite SHPE memory was last year at the National Conference when we were creating social media content for SHPE National.

Over time, it has become a space where I can grow, feel connected, and share experiences with people who understand my journey.

                                      My favorite SHPE memories are the trips I’ve taken with them, because traveling together gave me the chance to bond with friends, experience new places, and create moments that made me feel even more connected to the community.

                                         During my sophomore year, a friend told me about SHPE after his roommate from an internship recommended it to him. I decided to check it out and went to the first general meeting in Fall 2021. That’s when I realized SHPE/MAES had so many opportunities that could really help me land an internship or get scholarships.

                                      What's your favorite SHPE memory?
                                      In Fall 2023, we held one of our first SHPEtinas events at UTEP called "Women in STEM: It's Not in Your Head" with Dell. The room was packed with about 30 women, and the focus was on imposter syndrome and the struggles women face in STEM. What made it really special was how open everyone was—we shared our stories, related to each other's experiences, and had some really honest conversations. It felt personal, vulnerable, and honestly just comforting to know we've all gone through similar challenges.

                                    I first joined because of the National Convention, but I quickly realized all the tools and oportunities that the organization had to offer for me to advance and grow both academically and professionally. This made me want to be more involved, and eventually, become part of the leadership team of our chapter.

I really want to see more Latinos in STEM and help open doors for growth and professional development while still celebrating our culture and values. SHPEtinas means a lot to me because I want to inspire and empower more Latinas to find their passions in STEM and feel confident chasing their dreams.

                                    What's your favorite SHPE memory?
                                      The lawlessness of the national convention. When we went to SHPE National in Cali last year, it's so strange getting school excused so that you can take a trip to California and have fun but also be as stressed as you've ever been while meeting some of the biggest companies in the world.
